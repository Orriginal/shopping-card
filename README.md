# Giphy shop

This project is just a simple fake shop to get first time experience with React, GraphQL and Apollo. It uses the Giphy API to get the products and the Apollo client to fetch the data.

## Installation

Copy the `.env.dist` file to `.env` and set the `REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY` variable with your Giphy API key. I will send a key by email also, so you can use it.

Install all packages:
#### `npm install`

### Start the server:
Start the node server so the client can get data.
#### `npm run server-dev`

### Start the client:
#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
